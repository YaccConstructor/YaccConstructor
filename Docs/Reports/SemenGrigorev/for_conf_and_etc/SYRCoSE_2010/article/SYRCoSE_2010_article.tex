This is the abstract of my paper.  It must fit within the 
size allowed, which is about 3 inches, including section 
title, which is 11 point bold font.  If you don't want 
the text in italics, simply remove the 'em' command and 
the curly braces which bound the abstract text.  If you 
have em commands within an italicized abstract, the text 
will come out as normal (non-italicized) text. 
%end italics mode

\section{Introduction}
Here is my introduction text.  There are 2 blank lines 
before the section heading and one afterwards.  Heading 
text is 12 point bold font.  Paragraphs are not indented. 
I may want a numbered subsection, which is done as 
follows.

\subsection{Previous Work}
In subsections there is 1 blank line before the section 
heading and one afterwards.  Heading text is 11 point 
bold font.  Paragraphs are indented one pica.  There is 
no blank line between paragraphs.
Throughout I may cite references of the form 
\cite{key:foo} or \cite{foo:baz}, and LaTeX will keep 
track of numbering.  The numbers are based on the order 
you place them in the bibliography, not the order they 
appear in the text.  They should (I believe) be in 
alphabetical order.  LaTex will put square brackets about 
the number within the text of your paper.  For those of 
you new to the bibliography package, you may have to run 
the latex process twice to allow all references to be 
resolved. You will get a warning about a missing .aux 
file.  Just rerun latex and it will be ok.

\section{Summary and Conclusions}
This template will get you through the minimum article, 
i.e. no figures or equations.  To include those, please 
refer to your LaTeX manual and the IEEE publications 
guidelines.  Good Luck!
%this is how to do an unnumbered subsection

\subsection*{Acknowledgments}
This is how to do an unnumbered subsection, which comes 
out in 11 point bold font.  Here I thank my colleagues, 
especially Mike Gennert, who know more about Tex and 
Latex than I.
