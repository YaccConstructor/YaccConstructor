            An interface for a class that builds the actual layout from information 
            provided by the <see cref="T:Graphviz4Net.LayoutDirector"/>.

            <remarks>
            <para>
            The <see cref="T:Graphviz4Net.LayoutDirector"/> object directs the whole process of creating 
            the layout, when it has a piece of information about, e.g., a vertex position 
            and size, it passes this piece of information to the builder, so the builder can 
            create an actual vertex in the WPF Canvas, Windows Form, HTML/CSS files, ...
            </para>
            <para>
            The director gets an <c>original <see cref="T:Graphviz4Net.Graphs.IGraph"/></c> from the user, 
            then it uses dot to create a layout for it -- this results into a new 
            instance of the original graph, we will call it <c>dot graph</c>, 
            that contains layout information. Most of the builder methods has an 
            original graph element and then the dot graph element 
            among their parameters.
            </para>
            <para>
            Values generated by dot are passed to <see cref="T:Graphviz4Net.ILayoutBuilder`1"/> as they are. 
            So the conversion must be done by the builder (each build will probably perform 
            different kind of conversion). Dot used 2 axes X and Y. Position [0,0] is in 
            the top, left corner and it increases to the right and to the bottom. 
            Sizes (width, height) should be multiplied by 72 to have the same measure as positions.

            A vertex can have any general Id type. If you want to use the whole process of layout
