Graphviz4Net - Version 1
-------------------------------------------

Graphviz4Net provides WPF control that is capable of generating "nice looking" 
graph layouts with sub-graphs, curved edges with arrows, 
edges between sub-graphs and more. Nodes, edges and all other elements 
in the graph are fully customizable and can contain any other WPF controls 
(e.g., click-able buttons). Besides this WPF control, Graphviz4Net also 
provides .NET API for generating input and consuming the output of the 
Graphviz command line tool. 

-------------------------------------------
Installation:
	Graphviz4Net depends on command line tool called 'dot' that is part 
	of the GraphViz project (http://www.graphviz.org/). 
	Installation of Graphviz under Windows is pretty straightforward.
	
-------------------------------------------
Source code:
	To get the source code please visit the website of 
	this project (http://graphviz4net.codeplex.com/).
	
-------------------------------------------
Usage:
	The 'Example' folder contains an example of the usage of the WPF control, 
	which is quite easy. The documentation for the Graphviz to .NET API is 
	under construction. In the meantime one can use the 
	documentation comments in the source code. Some information can be 
	found in the Documentation section at Graphviz4Net codeplex page.
	
-------------------------------------------
I would like to thank the authors of GraphViz for their effort in 
this project and for making it open-source.
