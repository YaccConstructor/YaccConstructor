Introduction to Brahma version (c) 2010, Ananth B.

What is Brahma?
---------------
Brahma is an open-source library written for the .NET framework (in C#), to provide high-level access to parallel streaming computations on a variety of processors.

Brahma uses installed OpenCL drivers on your system to target any processor that your chosen platform can work with. Brahma uses my OpenCL bindings for .NET which are also open-source and can be found at http://openclnet.codeplex.com

What can I do with Brahma?
--------------------------
Brahma uses C#'s LINQ syntax to specify streaming transformation of data. Using Brahma, you can mix statements that run on the device and statements that run on the host CPU inside a single method! With absolutely *no* glue code required, a complex multipass streaming device computation with intervening host operations can be performed with just a few lines of code. All the glue and kernel code required is *automatically* generated by Brahma. All you need to do is write high-level .NET code.

What does it mean to me?
------------------------
With processor speeds levelling off, faster today often means "parallel". We are seeing a paradigm shift from traditional serial programming to concurrent programming models. Brahma lets you leverage either the powerful GPU you may already have on your system, or the increasingly many-core and powerful CPUs that are becoming ubiquitous. Brahma.OpenCL lets you use these powerful processors to perform blazing fast computations. However, OpenCL has a steep learning curve, not to mention knowledge of stream programming concepts. Such programs also tend to have a lot of "glue-code" to wire up the API, the "compute" language and host program. Brahma does all of this automagically, so all you care about is the LINQ query. It also has compiled queries, which provide very high performance for repeated runs.

In short, Brahma is a parallel computation framework that uses the functional features of C# to specify streaming transformations on data (a LINQ-to-streaming computation provider).
