<!--    
	As a default all available conversions, frontends and generators in folder "packages" are included in project

	If you don't want to use all of them remove the line 
		<Directory include-subdirs="true">../../../</Directory> 
	from this file
	
	If you want to include and use new module (conversion, frontend or generator) add the next line to this file
		<Directory>PATH</Directory>
	between tags
		<Addins> </Addins>
	PATH - path to directory with new module

	If you add attribute
		include-subdirs="true"
	in tag 
		<Directory> 
	searching new modules will be recursive. All modules in current directory and all modules in all subdirectories will be included

	ATTENTION. If you download new version of YC.Core this file will be rewrited to the begining version. 
		   So if you've modified it save all changes in some new file and then copy it back to the new version of YaccConstructor.addins
